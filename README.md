# I-Am-Rich

Armin Heinrich created the I Am Rich application, an iOS application that was distributed via the App Store. When the appÂ first launches, the only thing on the screen is a flickering red gem and an icon that when pressed shows a basic line. The app is characterised as "a work of art with no hidden function at all," with the sole purpose of demonstrating to others that they could afford it. I Am Rich was available for US$999.99 on the App Store. Apple Inc. removed the app from the App Store without warning the day after it was released, on August 6, 2008.
